# nship

nship is a flexible and efficient deployment automation tool designed to streamline the execution of deployment jobs across multiple targets. It simplifies the configuration and execution of deployment workflows by providing structured job and target management.

## Features

- Define deployment jobs with structured steps.
- Support for remote deployment targets with SSH authentication.
- Configuration management using YAML, JSON, TypeScript, JavaScript, or Golang.
- Built-in support for file copying, script execution, and Docker container management.
- Ansible Vault decryption support for handling secure credentials.
- Skipping unchanged steps for optimized execution.
- CLI-based execution with customizable environment loading.

## Getting Started

### Installation

To install nship, clone the repository and build the binary using Go:

```sh
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/nickalie/nship.git
cd nship

# Build the application
make build
```

Alternatively, you can install nship using Go:

```sh
go install github.com/nickalie/nship/cmd/nship@latest
```

### Usage

Run a deployment job using:

```sh
nship --config=config.yaml --job=deploy-app
```

Additional options:

- `--config=<path>`: Path to the configuration file (default: `nship.yaml`).
- `--job=<name>`: Name of the job to run.
- `--env=<paths>`: Comma-separated paths to environment files.
- `--vault-password=<password>`: Password for decrypting Ansible Vault files.
- `--no-skip`: Disable skipping unchanged steps.
- `--version`: Show version information.

## Configuration

nship uses a structured configuration file that can be written in YAML, JSON,Â TOML, TypeScript, JavaScript, Golang.

For TypeScript and JavaScript configuration files, Node.js must be installed. For Golang configuration files, Go must be installed.

### Example Configuration (YAML)

```yaml
targets:
  - name: production
    host: prod.example.com
    user: deploy
    private_key: ~/.ssh/id_rsa

jobs:
  - name: deploy-app
    steps:
      - run: echo "Deploying application..."
      - copy:
          src: ./app/
          dst: /var/www/app/
      - docker:
          image: myapp:latest
          name: myapp-container
          ports: ["8080:80"]
```

### Example Configuration (TypeScript)

```ts
export default {
  targets: [
    { name: "production", host: "prod.example.com", user: "deploy", private_key: "~/.ssh/id_rsa" }
  ],
  jobs: [
    {
      name: "deploy-app",
      steps: [
        { run: "echo \"Deploying application...\"" },
        { copy: { src: "./app/", dst: "/var/www/app/" } },
        { docker: { image: "myapp:latest", name: "myapp-container", ports: ["8080:80"] } }
      ]
    }
  ]
};
```

### Example Configuration (Golang)

```go
package main

import (
	"github.com/nickalie/nship/pkg/nship"
	"log"
)

func main() {
	err := nship.NewBuilder().
		AddTarget(&nship.Target{
			Host: "prod.example.com",
			User: "deploy",
			PrivateKey: "~/.ssh/id_rsa",
		}).
		AddJob("deploy-app").
		AddRunStep("echo 'Deploying application...'").
		AddCopyStep("./app/", "/var/www/app/").
		AddDockerStep(&nship.DockerStep{
			Image:    "myapp:latest",
			Name:     "myapp-container",
			Ports:    []string{"8080:80"},
		}).
		Print()

	if err != nil {
		log.Fatal(err)
	}
}
```

### Example Configuration (TOML)

```toml
[[targets]]
name = "production"
host = "prod.example.com"
user = "deploy"
private_key = "~/.ssh/id_rsa"

[[jobs]]
name = "deploy-app"

[[jobs.steps]]
run = "echo 'Deploying application...'"

[[jobs.steps.copy]]
src = "./app/"
dst = "/var/www/app/"

[[jobs.steps.docker]]
image = "myapp:latest"
name = "myapp-container"
ports = ["8080:80"]
```

## Deployment Steps

### Run Step

Executes a shell command:

```yaml
- run: systemctl restart myapp
```

### Copy Step

Copies files to a remote target. Identical files are not copied to optimize performance:

```yaml
- copy:
    src: ./config/
    dst: /etc/myapp/
```

### Docker Step

Runs a Docker container on the target. If the container already exists, it will be removed before starting a new instance:

```yaml
- docker:
    image: nginx:latest
    name: web-server
    ports: ["80:80"]
    environment:
      - "ENV_VAR=value"
    volumes:
      - "/host/path:/container/path"
    labels:
      app: "my-web-app"
    networks:
      - "custom-network"
    restart: "always"
    commands:
      - "npm install"
      - "npm start"
```

## Vault Support

nship supports Ansible Vault for secure credentials management. To decrypt a vault file, use:

```sh
nship --config=config.yaml --vault-password=yourpassword
```

## Skipping Unchanged Steps

By default, nship skips execution of unchanged steps to optimize performance. Use `--no-skip` to disable this behavior.
